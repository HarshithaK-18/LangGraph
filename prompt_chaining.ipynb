      "It’s 6:30 a.m. and the soft glow of your bedroom lights lifts just enough to coax you out of sleep. As you stretch, the thermostat already knows you’re about to head for a jog and nudges the temperature down to a crisp 65 °F. Your coffee maker, perched on the kitchen counter, starts brewing a latte the moment you step into the hallway—its timing calibrated to the exact moment you usually reach for a mug. Outside, a sleek, driver‑less pod glides silently to the curb, doors opening as you approach, ready to whisk you to the office while you sip your coffee and skim the morning headlines on a holographic display projected onto the windshield.\n",
      "\n",
      "That scene feels like science‑fiction, yet the building blocks are already here. In the last five years we’ve seen **machine‑learning models shrink enough to run on a chip the size of a fingernail**, **foundation models explode in capability**, and **data streams become richer and more real‑time than ever before**. The result? AI is slipping out of the lab and into the cracks of daily life, becoming an invisible, supportive layer that anticipates, adapts, and augments our routines.\n",
